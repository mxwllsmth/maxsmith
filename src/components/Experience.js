          <p>Over the five years that I worked at Bright Stars I was able to grow tremendously as a person and as an employee. Working in a fast paced and demanding</p>
          <p>environment had a lot to offer me, and through my time there I became an increasingly efficient worker, a stong team leader, and overall, a valuable</p> 
          <p>addition to any team. My responsibilities ranged from coaching, where I would teach classes, communicate with parents, and train team members - to</p> 
          <p>program management, where I would write lesson plans and lead our team of coaches - to customer service, where I dealt with some of our more</p> 
          <p>delicate situations and helped to ensure the gym was functioning in an organized and efficient mannor.</p> 
          <p></p>
          <p>During my time at Bright Stars I :</p>
          <p></p>
          <li>Taught the top recreational gymnastics classes in the area and offered a great amount of care, knowledge, and guidance to my students.</li>
          <li>Influenced all gym classes by creating new drills and sharing the ideas and methods that made my own classes so successful.</li>
          <li>Left a blueprint for how classes should be taught, including practicing proper/ safe progressions, and being a safe and effective coach.</li>
